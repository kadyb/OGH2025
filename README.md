# OpenGeoHub Summmer School 2025

This repository contains materials for the [OpenGeoHub Summer School 2025: "Data Science for Earth Observation"](https://opengeohub.org/summer-school/summer-school-2025/).

# Introduction

# Requirements

**Software**

You need to install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
and required packages in this way:

```r
install.packages(c("rstac", "terra", "imager", "sits"))
```

Please make sure everything is working properly beforehand.

**Skills**

The workshop is aimed at beginners, but basic knowledge of R programming, GIS and satellite remote sensing
is required. If you want to expand your knowledge, I highly recommend the following materials:

1. Book "[Spatial Data Science with R and “terra”](https://rspatial.org/)" by Robert Hijmans et at.
2. Book "[Satellite Image Time Series Analysis on Earth Observation Data Cubes](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/)"
   by Gilberto Camara et at.

**Hardware**

Your computer should have a minimum of 8 GB of RAM and an Internet connection.
