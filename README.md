# OpenGeoHub Summmer School 2025

This repository contains materials for the [OpenGeoHub Summer School 2025: "Data Science for Earth Observation"](https://opengeohub.org/summer-school/summer-school-2025/).

# Introduction

These workshops introduce the basic concepts and practical techniques for working with remote
sensing data in the R programming language. During the course, we will discuss how to access,
process, and analyze satellite data using a comprehensive ecosystem of spatial packages.
We will also cover automation and workflow reproducibility, which are very useful in real-world
applications. Workshops aim to provide the essential knowledge and practical skills needed to start
your own projects involving the acquisition and processing of remote sensing data.
Feel free to ask questions and get involved!

# Requirements

**Software**

You need to install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
and required packages in this way:

```r
install.packages(c("rstac", "terra", "imager", "sits"))
```

Please make sure everything is working properly beforehand.

**Skills**

The workshop is aimed at beginners, but basic knowledge of R programming, GIS and satellite remote sensing
is required. If you want to expand your knowledge, I highly recommend the following materials:

1. Book "[Spatial Data Science with R and “terra”](https://rspatial.org/)" by Robert Hijmans et at.
2. Book "[Satellite Image Time Series Analysis on Earth Observation Data Cubes](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/)"
   by Gilberto Camara et at.

**Hardware**

Your computer should have a minimum of 8 GB of RAM and an Internet connection.
